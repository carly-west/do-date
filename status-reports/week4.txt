Name: Carly Correa
Project Title: DoDate

Team Members: Myself!

Overall Status: On-schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 6
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 25
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 126

Accomplishments:
1. Organized assignments by their due and do dates
2. Added some styling to each page.
3. Added a "Due Date" field for the user to input and add to Firestore database.
4. Added a "remove assignment" button that allows users to remove all of the assigments they have checked off
5. Updated the organization of the "do" and "due" dates based on what the user has selected.

Challenges:
I haven't ran into many challenges this week! It was a bit more difficult than I anticipated to add another field to each assignment. Github pages also isn't working the way I expected it to.

Plans / Goals for next week:
I hope to fully figure out the hosting of my project, because of Github pages is registering the incorrect page as the main page. I also am hoping to add some security to the website to only allow users the ability to enter certain pages if they are logged in.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
I will continue to keep track of my hours worked, as well as be sure to work a bit extra to stay on track.
