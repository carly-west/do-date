Name: Carly Correa
Project Title: DoDate

Team Members: Myself!

Overall Status: On-schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 7
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 7
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 120

Accomplishments:
1. I was able to get my project started and up on GitHub.
2. I created a Firebase database and set up authentication.
3. I got logging in/logging out and registering functionalities completed.

Challenges:
Firebase authentication was much more difficult than I expected. The majority of the time working on this project so far has been working on getting that set up.

Plans / Goals for next week: Style the header and login/register pages. Also change text in header when the user is logged in.


Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
I will keep track of the hours that I spend working on the project, and partion out my time better to avoid spending hours and hours on the project in the same day.
